Hi, I'm "[[https://oylenshpeegul.gitlab.io/blog/posts/20230612/][Timmy from Baltimore]]!"

I wrote [[https://oylenshpeegul.gitlab.io/from-perl-to-rust/][From Perl to Rust]], a guide to learning Rust for folks who already know Perl.

- Note that Perl and Rust are both real towns in Germany. I created that map on the first page by asking [[https://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]] for directions. Then I added the names in big letters with [[https://www.gimp.org/][GIMP]].

I also [[https://oylenshpeegul.gitlab.io/blog/posts/][have a blog]], where I sometimes write about programming, books, movies, and anything else that strikes my fancy.
